# Portfolio Simulator (C Programming Project)

## Overview

This project is a command-line based Portfolio Simulator developed as part of a first-semester C programming course. The program allows users to manage stock holdings through a menu-driven interface. Users can buy and sell shares, update market prices, view their complete portfolio, compute profit or loss metrics, and save or load portfolio data from a file. The objective of the project is to practice structured programming, arrays, file handling, input validation, and modular function design.

## What This Project Does

* Stores and displays stock holdings
* Allows buying and selling of shares
* Updates market prices individually or for all holdings
* Calculates cost basis, market value, and profit/loss
